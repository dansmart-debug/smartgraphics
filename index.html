                    Graphic design is a craft where professionals create visual content to communicate messages. 
                    By applying visual hierarchy and page layout techniques, designers use typography and pictures 
                    to meet users' specific needs and focus on the logic of displaying elements in interactive designs, 
                    to optimize the user experience.

                    Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) 
                    or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page 
                    of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.

                <p>
                    Multimedia is a form of communication that uses a combination of different content forms such as text, 
                    audio, images, animations, or video into a single interactive presentation, in contrast to traditional mass media, 
                    such as printed material or audio recordings, which features little to no interaction between users. 
                    Popular examples of multimedia include video podcasts, audio slideshows and animated videos.
